# Automation Project with Playwright + Shiftleft Testing

This project contains automated tests for a TODO list application, utilizing
Playwright and **Shiftleft Testing practices and tools** to ensure high-quality
code from the
start.

      by
      running tests in a random order.~~
- **Quality Assurance**:
    - **SonarQube**: Integrated for continuous code quality analysis.
    - **Gherkin Linter**: Maintains consistency in Gherkin syntax for BDD (
      Behavior-Driven Development).
- **Development Environment**:
    - **VSCode & IntelliJ IDEA Settings**: Pre-configured settings for an
      optimal development experience.
    - **Husky**: Git hooks for enforcing pre-commit checks, such as linting and
